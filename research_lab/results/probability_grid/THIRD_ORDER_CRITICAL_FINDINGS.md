## 🎓 The Market Psychology

**Why does this happen?**

1. **Initial Break**: Early movers/algorithms break the level
2. **Mean Reversion**: Profit-takers exit, causing pullback
3. **Re-Test**: New participants join the move (FOMO), breaking level again
4. **Confirmation**: Second break confirms the move is real

The 3% that stay inside? Those are the rare range-bound days or strong reversals.
