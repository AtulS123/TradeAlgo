# Trading Terminology Explained

## What Does "FADE" Mean?

**FADE = Trade in the OPPOSITE direction of the move**

This is a **contrarian/mean reversion strategy** where you bet that the initial move is false and will reverse.

## Examples

### 1. Fade a Breakdown

**Situation:**

- Price breaks **DOWN** below support (previous day's low)
- Most traders are selling (going short)

**What YOU do (Fade it):**

- **GO LONG** (buy) - opposite of the crowd
- You're betting the breakdown is false and price will return UP

**Why it works:**

- 87% of breakdowns from inside range return to range
- Average return time: 9 minutes

### 2. Fade a Breakout

**Situation:**

- Price breaks **UP** above resistance (previous day's high)
- Most traders are buying (going long)

**What YOU do (Fade it):**

- **GO SHORT** (sell) - opposite of the crowd
- You're betting the breakout is false and price will return DOWN

**Why it works:**

- 85% of breakouts from inside range return to range
- Average return time: 11 minutes

## The Psychology

**Why do false breakouts happen?**

1. **Early movers** break the level (algorithms, stop-loss triggers)
2. **FOMO traders** chase the move (late entries)
3. **Smart money** takes profit, causing reversal
4. **Price returns** to previous range (mean reversion)

**You profit by:**

- NOT chasing the initial move
- Waiting 5-10 minutes for confirmation
- Entering OPPOSITE direction when momentum fades
- Taking profit when price returns to range boundary

## Real Example

**Scenario:** NIFTY opens at 21,425 (INSIDE yesterday's 21,350-21,500 range)

**9:30 AM:** Price breaks below 21,350 → drops to 21,320

- **Crowd action:** Everyone sells (panic)
- **Your action:** Wait and watch (don't chase)

**9:45 AM:** Still at 21,320-21,330

- **Your fade trade:** **BUY (GO LONG)** at 21,330
- **Reasoning:** 87% chance it returns to 21,350
- **Stop loss:** 21,300 (30 points risk)
- **Target:** 21,350 (20 points reward)

**10:00 AM:** Price back at 21,350

- **Result:** +20 points profit ✓
- **The breakdown was false**, just as predicted!

## When NOT to Fade

❌ **Don't fade if:**

- Move sustains after 10 AM (trend is real, not false)
- High volume confirms the breakout
- Strong news/event driving the move
- You're in the 13-15% minority where it doesn't return

✅ **Safe to fade when:**

- Move happens 9:00-9:30 AM (40% of moves happen here)
- Low/medium volume (suggests false move)
- No major news
- You have 87% statistical edge!

**Bottom Line:**
FADE means be a contrarian - when everyone buys, you sell. When everyone sells, you buy. In NIFTY, this works 87% of the time for morning breakouts!
